This folder contains neccesary files for running thermodynamic integration simulations from the neural network potential to the MBPOL water potential.

Steps:

* Copy the files from ../NN-potential/

* Make a few directories. Substitute the weight factor lambda (AW) between the two potential.  HW=1.0-AW

* Run at different values of lambda.
